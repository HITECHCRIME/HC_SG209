## Lyrics

```
all your wounds stitched
with a piece of black rope
tell me if you're a blood witch
in my mind I'm too savage with no hope

but is it really savage more than you
is it really too much promise to feel used

maybe you're here to make me heal
make me whole again through the secret runes 
it's the sacred ordeals of the thuul
so please put your mark on me 


```
