## Lyrics

```
all your wounds stitched so
with a piece of black rope
tell me if you're a blood witch
in my mind hope 

too savage with no hope

but is it really savage more than you
is it really too much promise to feel used
maybe you're here to make me heal
make me whole again through the secret runes 

it's the sacred ordeals of the thuul
so please witch, put your mark down 
make me feel, place the chant one thee

only one stitched soul
with a piece of black of rope

```
